Hi!

My name is Steve Bilogan, I'm a Senior Engineer and one of the core maintainers of the open-source Uno Platform project. I also speak at conferences and meetups, and I develop and maintain an [AA Daily Reflections app][aa-daily-reflections] for Android and iOS.


You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
