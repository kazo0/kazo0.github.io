Hi :wave:!

My name is Steve Bilogan, I'm a Senior Engineer, .NET Microsoft MVP, and one of the core maintainers of the open-source [Uno Platform project][uno-platform], including [Uno Themes][uno-themes], [Uno Toolkit][uno-toolkit], and [Uno Extensions][uno-extensions]. I also speak at conferences and meetups, and I develop and maintain an [AA Daily Reflections app][aa-daily-reflections] for Android and iOS.

When not at my computer, I'm either watching the Montreal Canadiens lose or asleep on the couch with my wonderful wife, Michele, and our little monster, Penny.
