Over the past 6 years at Uno Platform I feel like I have learned an insane amount of things, both technical and non-technical. Prior to that, I had another 6+ years of consulting and building mobile apps. Looking back at my first years, I remember stepping into each new day with an anxiety attack waiting right under the surface. I was constantly worried about not being good enough, not knowing enough, not being able to deliver on time, not being able to help my team, and on and on. To quote Coach Jimmy McGinty from The Replacements:

> Like a duck on the pond. On the surface everything looks calm, but beneath the water those little feet are churning a mile a minute.

A lot has changed since then and I am now a much more confident engineer. Solving complex problems, voicing my opinions, and building some really cool stuff. Over the last little while, I pretty much just gave myself the title of Senior Engineer. Putting it in my about me sections, slide decks for conferene talks, etc. At the time, I really thought that's what I was. Then came the actual work and responsilities of a lead/senior role. I quickly realized that it takes a lot more than just writing code for many years in order to enter into a senior role. Managing projects, maintaining backlogs, interacting with clients, and helping/mentoring the junior engineers. All of a sudden, we are back in those first years of uncertainty and anxiety. I'm not a project manager, or a professional tech coach, or a client relations expert. These aren't skills that I possess naturally. When you are part of a smaller team, you have to wear many hats. No one else is going to do the work for you. You have to learn and adapt.
