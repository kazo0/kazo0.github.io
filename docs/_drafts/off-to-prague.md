I'm excited to be speaking at [Update Conference 2023][update-conf-site] in Prague, Czech Republic! I'll be presenting [Create Beautiful .NET Apps Faster with Uno Platform][update-conf-uno-talk] with the legendary Martin Zikmund ([@mzikmunddev][martin-twitter]) on Thursday, November 27th at 9:00am CET. We are also going to be running a booth at the conference with fellow Uno Platform team member, Dominik Titl ([@morning4coffe][dominik-twitter]).

I've been working with Martin and Dominik for quite some time and I am pumped to finally meet them in person! This will be my first time in Prague and I'm looking forward to exploring the city and finding some cool places to eat.

## The Talk

Martin and I will be talking about how you can use Uno Platform to create beautiful .NET apps faster. We'll be covering the basics of Uno Platform, how to get started, and highlighting some of the new features released as part of the [5.0 release][uno-5-release]. We'll also be showing off all of the non-UI APIs that we support as well the [Uno Themes][uno-themes] and [Uno Toolkit][uno-toolkit] libraries, which are maintained by yours truly :smirk:.
